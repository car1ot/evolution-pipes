Level passwords:

4 level - ❌;
5 level - ❌;
6 level - ❌;

Known limitations of your solution:
High levels have a lot of pipes and they are hard to render (I made chunks system to split big game fields);
Sometimes websocket server response time is too long;

Key design decisions made, especially if you considered multiple options:
In this project I liked to use React list rendering to display pipes;
I used Redux state management to improve project structure and store game data in one place;
I used localStorage (store2) to save game progress, so player will not loose level progress;
